The wine-staging patch msvcrt-Math_precision causes the char to fall through the planet and the sound goes scary scratching crazy.
That means, a full wine-5.22 (Staging) will cause issues with SC.
The fix came 10 hours after release, so it will not be in until the rebased 5.23 staging patches release.

A commit in wine-5.19 caused a regression with the launcher, the launcher window stays plain white.
Thanks to @dev_zero who found the offending commit.
Bugreport is here: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49991

There is an issue with shadows/lighting in 3.11 for RADV users.
Here is the issue report @dev_zero created https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3615

[07 October 2020]
Avoid updating to launcher v1.4.5 which was pulled by CIG.
Link to previous launcher https://install.robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen/RSI-Setup-1.4.4.exe

[03 October 2020]
The launcher crashes on load.
Thats an issue by the launcher using 3d accelleration, what failed for some players.
To prevent the crash, use a gl override option like this:
wine "RSI Launcher.exe" "--use-gl=osmesa"
See bugreport here: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49633

@dev_zero found a commit in dxvk 1.7.1 that enabled a vulkan extension that was not fully supported in mesa(radv) for AMDgpu users.
It was fixed by Valve's Pierre-Loup and available in the latest mesa master.

@Yuritau found an issue with our runners dropping a thread error, when Lutris has the switch "Prefer System Libraries" set to ON.
To get over the thread issue if you have it, you need to make sure to keep that switch OFF!

Please send a log to @beniwtv about these crashes, the Lutris devs want to know about these crashes to fix their runtime.

[19 July 2020]
@dev_zero has made a pullrequest at MangoHud to implement the changes for a wine version string and color selection of that string.
To test it, clone the right gitbranch:

git clone -b wine2 https://github.com/gort818/MangoHud.git mangohud

next join the mangohud directory and enter

./build.sh build
./build.sh package
./build.sh install

Your mangohud config is in /home/you/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf .
Visit that file and edit it for your needs.
To show the wine version in the overlay, add wine=1 to the config file.
To change the color, add wine_color=0x22bb88 as example to the config file as well.

Mike_Scott solved the issue with the wine version string in MangoHud.
After /dev/null put a lot effort in creating the backyard for a wine version string in MangoHud, Mike_Scott could fix a nasty issue.
Expect a official MangoHud addition, that can show the current used wine version

DXVK async patch to make shader compiling faster by @dev_zero
https://github.com/gort818/dxvk/releases/download/async/dxvk-async.tar.gz

Warning: Async leads to shaders missing while they are loading, and doesn't block the game. Hence, it could be regarded as cheating by anti-cheat software. While SC does not yet have anti-cheat (as far as we know), use at your own risk!
