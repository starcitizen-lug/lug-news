#LUG news for 2022

(Jun 13, 2022)
Another issue popped up in wine, needs another patch to fix a bug causing the launcher to freeze at 100% cpu,
we think due to too small heapspace size. When its not fixed in wine-7.11, we have at least a patch at hand.

SC 3.17.1 currently requires a Wine patch to play. 
Work is going on to add that to upstream Wine, but in the meantime, you can build with this patch, 
or use one of the pre-compiled versions from GloriousEggroll or RawFox, available from the lug-helper.

Note to Nvidia users: DXVK v1.9.3+ seems to only work for non-RTX cards. 
We recommend using DXVK v1.9.2 installed from the LUG Helper. Alternatively, try a patched version of DXVK from gnusenpai, 
also available in the Helper. Note that this patched version may not work with other games.

Note to Nvidia users: wine versions 7.3+ have been problematic for some users. 
Issues vary but errors may include virtual_setup_exception stack overflow when compiling shaders. 
We recommend the GE 7.2 release if you are experiencing problems or crashes.

Note to Nvidia users: Driver v495 causes issues for most people. 
If you have unresolvable performance issues with 510, try 470.

Glorious Eggroll runners are now based on Proton experimental instead of wine staging. 
The release version numbers no longer correspond to wine version numbers. 
The major version number reflects the Proton version it is based on. The numbers after the dashes only reflect GE releases/patches.

Easy Anti-Cheat is live. CIG is aware of the problem but there is still no ETA. 
There is a workaround, but we can't officially recommend it. There are currently no consequences that we are aware of for using the workaround, 
but CIG has said that eventually people will be kicked for tripping EAC. Ask in any of our social channels or use the LUG Helper.

DXVK version 1.9.2L-3e64e1b can cause cache corruption problems. We recommend using either 1.9.2L or a newer version.
