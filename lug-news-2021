Wine-6.22 can run StarCitizen out of the box again. CIG disabled EAC and the wine issue got fixed before it had a bugreport.

SC-3.15.1 introduced EAC, wich is not working on the current PTU:
https://issue-council.robertsspaceindustries.com/projects/STAR-CITIZEN/issues/STARC-23611
Wine has a regression since todays commits, still needs a bugreport on bugzilla and some bisecting to find the exact commit.

[11.Nov.2021]
@theSane added a QuickStart guide to our README here:

@theSane is back and has pushed the lug-helper even futher, supports the installation of dxvk-async and had a lot of tweaks and fixes.
You get the script here: https://github.com/the-sane/lug-helper/releases

While bug 51626 is on the way to get fixed, another problem turned up.
SC performs worse and the reason is not ntdll-ForceBottomUpAlloc, rather then some other staging patch from the ntdll-* patches.

[04.Sep.2021]
The bug on ntdll-ForceBottomUpAlloc has a bugreport on Bugzilla now.
https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51720

[17.Aug.2021]
A new regression has been caught by @ngh bisecting wine vanilla HEAD.
Thanks to him, we could create a bugreport and its on the way to fixland now

The hostile patches are ntdll-ForceBottomUpAlloc, ntdll-WRITECOPY, ntdll-Builtin_Prot .
Building wine-staging without those patches does work with StarCitizen.
No idea, who actually found them, but @Ackurus was on it and told us.

@TinybuttMike found out, that StarCitizen is working fine with just a plain and unmodified wine.
Thanks a lot, Tbutt, we all ran over selfbuilt walls  
The issues seem to be completely relaing on some wine-staging patches, and we will find them^^

[05.Jun.2021]
Wine-6.10 has released and its still not working with StarCitizen.
It still needs a fix for this bug:
https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51065
The added patches do not apply to the current wine-staging anymore and tweaking them in does not work with the game.
For now, we relay again on Molotov's runner, wich is patched and can drive StarCitizen 100%:

[07.May.2021]
Bug 50992 got fixed!
https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50992
Sadly it does not fix the runability with StarCitizen, we still need a patch, developed by
@MikeScott , @Ackurus , @ngh and some other #LUG members, were Netho made it actually work.

@molotov_sh has a Lutris runner available, that is tested and works very nice with SC-3.13.
There is a version for Fsync as well, so if you can not patch your local wine, using this runner is recommended for now.
https://github.com/snatella/wine-runner-sc/releases/tag/wine-v6.6

[15.Apr.2021]
The SC-3.13 PTU was not loading due to a advapi32.dll error, wine has no WMIAPI implemented yet.
Some people had a lot energy to talk about solutions, testing, debugging and writing patches, thanks to you all
@ngh finally found the right return and made at least a stub of the missing function working, so that we can load the game again.

@pstn bridged all the discord rooms to matrix if you want to, you can join:
#lug-general:xndr.de
#lug-announcements:xndr.de
#lug-tech-support:xndr.de
#lug-memes:xndr.de
#lug-screenshots:xndr.de
Of course it's provided as a best effort service with no guarantees and discords privacy policy applies but at least you don't have to make an account there. We used https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord.
When the new communities are out, we'll evaluate how to use them to bundle the rooms.
Oh and as stated in spectrum: The current Matrix channel will remain unchanged, and unbridged.

@Ackurus has got a working patch to fix the C++ runtime error - see https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/LUG/forum/194647/thread/queue-apc-patch-change-how-wineserver-handles-queu

For those having issues with their rudder pedals not being available in the game, @beniwtv made a workaround script that emulates a "more complete" joystick, so the game will use it:
